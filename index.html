  <p>Hey there. Just a little unfancy page to introduce myself quickly.<br>
    I'm in touch with programming since my childhood as this was a recurring topic at the dinnertable of my family (all of them are actually Engineers).<br>
    I studied Mechanical Engineering though but gravitatet many years ago organically from creating and maintaining simple Websites into the Programming of modern web applications. 
    This is what I do happyli till this day.<br> 
    So call me Junior, Mid or Senior (I don't feel that old...) - it doesn't really matter. I know I can deliver stuff, work in a team and make people (Businesses) happy. And surely there is always something for me to learn along the way.</p>
